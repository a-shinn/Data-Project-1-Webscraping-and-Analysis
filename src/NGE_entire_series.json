When the operation is over , I will         invite you to a steak dinner.","Misato : Being impossible to estimate the exact point, this is the         collision point collision estimated by Magi        from the data obtained just before missing.","Misato : Under these conditions, we set each Eva Unit at each        of these three points.","Misato : They are OK. No matter how Evas are damaged,        A.T. field will save them. Inside Eva is the safest.","Misato : Shinji-kun, you asked yesterday why I joined NERV.        My father threw himself into his research,... only his dream.        I did not forgive him, or rather , I did hate him.","Misato : He didn't take care of me, my mother and the family. People said        that he was sensitive. But he was so weak that he was always        trying to escape from the reality, our family. He was just like a kid.        I agreed with my mother when she divorced my father, since        she had been always crying. My father seemed to have shocked,        though I grinned him who was suffering from the consequence of        his own.  He saved me for his life, and then died, in that        Second impact.  I don't see if I'd loved him or hated him.        One thing clear was that I had to defeat the Angels that had        caused the Second Impact. To do that, I joined NERV. It might        be that I was trying to revenge on my father, in order to be        free from my father's spell.","Misato : The target's trajectory is calculated based only on the        optical observation. Magi will induce you until the distance is        1000. After that, do on your own accord. I entrust you all.","Misato : I'm very sorry. Unit one was damaged due to my selfish judgment. I am         completely responsible for that.","Misato : Alright. I've drawn big bills from the bank. I can pay for the        full-course dinner,... although shortly before the payday. ","Misato: You are great, Ritsuko.  You have three of those same hard-to-take-        care-of things, and still making it by time.","Misato: It's so fast. MAGI, oh great MAGI.  I just cannot believe it took        a week on the first test.","Misato: The only effective way to fight with subject which constantly evolve        and over come its weakness is take it with us.  Only way is to MAGI to        commit suicide and take it with MAGI.  I suggest physical elimination of        MAGI.","Misato: You've been always like that.  Keep everything to yourself and never        depend on the others.","Misato: You can make the program by the time, right?  If Casper is taken over        completely, that's it for us.","Misato: Yap.  It is the system to transfer a person's personality and make        the 7th generation organic computer to think by itself.  It is used       to operate EVA, too.","Misato: Although our damage resultant was terribly large,","Misato: the challenge of the unexperienced boy         to the first battle against the unknown target","Misato: and the fact that he carried out the challenge        were indeed admirable deeds of Ikari Shinji.","Misato: However, for the section of planning, it was a hard        battle that revealed further more problems and many        points to improve.","Misato: Unit Zero for the first time, because it's different Eva,        it's reasonable.","Misato: This incident has something to do with that incident of going wild?        That incident of Rei?","Misato: As the planning manager, I request you to do it immediately,        before that troubles our job.","Misato:         Oh, you mean the wedding party?                I had on that suits in pink at Kiyomi's party.                I just recently had on that dress in navy-blue at Kotoko's.","Misato:         That's right.                Phew.                Should I buy new one on the way home?                That will cost a lot.","Misato:         Shit! Every one is eager to marry before they get                thirty years old.","Misato:         That's not for you, a child.                Shinji-kun is in his room?","Misato:         You are afraid of that? To be with your father alone?                It's no good to always escape.                You must go one step further.                Otherwise nothing will change.","Misato:         You are going to know,                Not only the first step, but also you have to continue                to step after the first one.                Anyhow, you must go there with the strong mind tomorrow,                since you will meet your mother.","Misato:         Anyhow, why don't you shave that sloppy beard?                 And the tie is not set correctly.","Misato:         It's too late to say such a thing.                I'll fix my hear.","Misato:         I am sorry that I insisted to separate at that time.                I told you that I had another one to love,                yet it was a lie.                Did you find that?","Misato:         I found, I found that you had something that resembled to my                father.                I was looking for the appearence of my father. When I found                that, I feared. I feared everything.                I feared to be with you.                I feared to be a woman. I feared everything.                Although I'd hated my father,                I happened to love a man looking like my father.","Misato:         To forget everything, I joined NERV, which, however, was an                institute at that my father had been.                I have been pretending to revenge Angels.                Phew.","Misato:         No! I did not choose that way. I just tried to escape.                I just tried to escape from my father's spell.                Just like Shinji-kun.                I am cowardly.                I am sorry.                 Tonight, I'm speaking this kind a thing because I am drunk.                ","Misato:         And moreover, I try to depend on a man only in such a situation                like this. I am a foul woman.                At that time, I might have made use of you.                I hate myself!","Misato:         I despair of myself!                uuh...","Misato:         Is this your true job?                Or part-time job?","Misato:         The person belonging to the special section of inspection,                of the special institute NERV is Kanji Ryouji,                at the same time, you are a person belonging to                the inquiry section of the Japan's ministry of interior,                Kaji Ryouji.","Misato:         On my own accord. If you do this part-time job further,                you shall die.","Misato:         Since I appreciate your yesterday's matter,                I allow you about that.","Misato:         This is...                Eva?...                No,..                Is this...","Misato:         Adam?                That first Angel is here?                Well, NERV is less cheaper than I've held","Misato : Oh,oh.That's Shin-chan's life-style. ","Misato : Shut up. ow!        Well,how about the Third Children?        ","Misato : Well.        Wow,(looking at the monitor) I hope he gains confidence         to know this.        ","Misato : Ah, sorry.        What's going on? The observation centre of Mt.Fuji did ...        ","Misato :Can you hear me?        Target's data are those I've sent.        Presently, we don't have further data.        Approach carefully, watch its reaction,        and If possible, lead it to outside the urban area.","Misato : Stop, you people.        Yes, he acted arbitrarily without consultation.        So I'll have to scold him when he's back.        ","Misato : Forced salvaging Eva ? ","Misato : But, you know, how Eva's body, eee,        will be. Heck,         It's not the rescue operaion.        ","Misato : What's the reason why you and the commandor Ikari        stick on the Unit One ?        Huh, what is Eva ?        ","Misato : (thought) I understand that EVA isn't just a copy of         the First Angel, though, how is NERV going to use EVAs        after it defeats all Angels ?        ","Misato : Shinji-kun, Shinji-kun, Shinji-kun!-        Shinji-kun, are you alright ? Shinji-kun!!        (weep)        ","Misato: Yes.        His emotion is very unstable.        I don't think it's a good idea that he stands here at the moment.","Misato: The report from the experiencee does not suggest that.        Presumably, it was an irregular incident.","Misato: I am not able to answer that question.        Do Angels have the concept of mind?        Do they understand human thoughts?        Those are absolutely unknown.","Misato: Considering the patterns so far,        the systematic coupling among the Angels is negative.","Misato: As for the Unit three and four, they insisted the right        of the construction, and forced to build them.        But, now, they force us to accept that.        They push their luck.","Misato: Then, how to do the booting test?        using Rei's dummy?","Misato: The Fourth?        The fourth children was found?","Misato: Well, OK.        And, who is the selected child?","Misato: It's hard to tell this.        Asuka is OK. She is proud of pilotting Eva.        Rei is exceptional.        Nothing good if concerned with Eva things and our matters.        It is Shinji that knows these matters best.        I don't want him to be more painful.","Misato: Although I don't say anything about your private life,        I beg you not to seduce young girls here in this emergent        situation.","Misato: It depends on your answer you are about to say.        You must know the secrets of Malduk Institute and ADAM         underground.","Misato: I don't care a bit what people say about me.        I am not reserved at the moment.        Timely the fourth children was found.        What is the hidden reason for that?","Misato: Nothing but NERV?        Commander Ikari?","Misato: Seven O Seven?        Shinji-kun's school?","Misato:That was true.  Unit 4 is gone with the NERF 2nd Branch.  During the        test of S2 Engine.        We are OK here. All three units are working OK. Both the pilots and        the staffs are excellent, too.","Misato: Mmmm, I'll leave the house for about 4days, but don't warry since        Kaji will take care of you guys.","Misato: I just can't find a chance to say that.  I'm afraid since I can't         figure out what he is thinking about.","Misato: Late for two hours, and at last, he is here.        He is the first guy to make me wait this long.","Misato: Exclusive possession of four EVAs...  If we want, we can ends this         world.","Misato: Alive...        Kaji....?","Misato: The pilot for the Unit 3 is,        The 4th Children is","Misato:   There is no problem in so far as I can work.          I just can't be off in this state of emergency.          What happened to Shinji-kun?","Misato:   I think you know, but there will be a fair amount of restrictions          on your behavior.","Misato:   The fourth level candidates are all your class mates.          I learned that recently too.          It was all contrived.","Misato:   As for Suzuhara-kun's matter,          it's not a mistake recovered by apologizing with any words.          But Shinji-kun, to be honest, I was projecting my dream,          hope and purpose upon you.          I know it's been a load to you.          But we, everyone at NERV, had no choice but to trust our           future to you.          Just remember that, please.","Misato:   I know that.          I'll leave your pass-code up to the headquarters and your room          as they are.","Misato:   (He's speaking positively [in his own words].           It's the first time to hear something like this.)","Misato:   Post Unit Two in the Geofront,          on the rim of the Headquarters facilities.-          Let Asuka snipe the target at the instant it invades into theGeofront!-          The Unit Zero status?","Misato:   Asuka!          Cut all the nerve connection.  Fast!","Misato:   It's coming here.          All personnel to be evacuated.  Fast!","Misato: Only with the visible situations, we can't decide how we   should do with it. ","Misato: I can't believe it! What the hell is the matter with   Shinji-kun? ","Misato: Created by humans? You only make a copy of what you pick up   on Antarctica then. Original? I'm dumbfounded. ","Misato: Do something! You made that, didn'd you? Take the   consequences! ","Misato: I don't know. What Nerv want isn't his life but Unit One as   their tool. ","Misato: You mean that Shinji has transformed into something which we   can't identify visibly? ","Misato: You're saying about the theory, aren't you? Nobody knows the   results without doing. ","Misato: I'm kind to you. Well, Shinji-kun. Do you want to become one   with me? Do you want us to become one both mentally and   physically? That's so comfortable. I'm ready. I'm always ready. ","Misato: Shinji-kun, you are here because you got into Eva. Because   you got into Eva, you became what you are. You can't deny that,   the fact that you got into Eva nor what you were, your past life. ","Misato: (wailing) What a nonsense the science which can't save even a   person. ","Misato: Human-made-human Evangelion. Although it was made by humans,   don't you think the black box is too large? I'm satisfied because   Shinji-kun was finally saved. ","Misato: Others ... I'm right? You aren't interested in others but you   feel lonely. You're really like my father. ","Misato: At present, it's important that I let you know my hope. What   is the true goal of Nerv and Commander Ikari? ","Misato: Wait, dodge my questions by doing such a thing. No, don't put   such a thing in. Well, what are you doing in such a time? ","Misato:         Hello, I am absent at the moment. Please leave your message                after a tone signal.","Misato:         That's inside of this installation.                You, people of the division of intelligence, did nothing                against that?","Misato:         The guy who can baffle the Second section of Intelligence                division.                That is, ","Misato:         Considering the carrier of me and him, this is a quite natural                consequence.","Misato:         I still hate darkness.                That reminds me of notthig but horrible things.","Misato:         Yeah, Katsuragi Misato, Nice to meet you.","Misato : (monologue)              (What was born from Adam, that is series of Evas.               We  have no other way to defeat the Angels without utilizing the               very cause which lead to the Second Impact.               In other words, those who utilize even the thing that triedto destroy              themselves, they are the human beings.)","Misato : They started the construction of the Evas until Number  13 ?             In seven places all over the world ?","Misato : Why they hurry up building in this time ?                   ","Misato : Who knows ?             Even for us, we got the parts from Germany which were             originally made for Unit-5 and 6.             Nowadays they spend much money.","Misato : Hooom...    But there are no reason for them to do             informally.   There should be another aim.","Misato :   Although it's been long since we were together last.                But what is this unsociable atmosphere ?","Misato : Asuka is under a bad condition.  She is during the second             day of that .","Misato : It's a natural course, after beaten in that way.             Moreover, much worse is that she feels as she was                                 beaten by Shinji.             Maybe it's our limitation.  I'm afraid we three could not             live together.","Misato : I won't allow to say that phrase from you who conceal her             loneliness with cats.","Misato : Oh, I am very sorry !             I'm slightly upset.","Misato : That means,  that is waiting for the chance of             coming down, or that is going to destroy us without             approaching ?","Misato : Anyway, we can do nothing  unless that approaches to              within our firing range.             Eva cannot beat the enemy over the satellite orbit.             How's Rei  ?","Misato : Roger.   Unit-0, Sortie!  Prepare for the very-long-             distance firing.--              Unit-2, Asuka, be ready to the sortie for               covering. ","Misato : That's right. Take the rear guard ","Misato : It's being frozen by  Commander Ikari's absolute order.

Asuka, I order you to retreat.","Misato : Transport Unit-0 by air ?             Shoot the target from sky ?             No, we can't do that.             If the Angel shoot Unit-0 during the approaching, we              can't protect.","Misato : But, there is the possibility that the contact of Adam and Eva             will cause the Third Impact.   That's too dangerous.              Commander Ikari, please do not do that !","Misato : (monologue)            (That isn't a true story?  That is a lie?             The Second Impact was not caused by the contact with Angel.)","Misato : You say the third impact will not be aroused by such a little             thing.   So, what is the real cause of the second impact ?","Misato:         The telephone which does not ring...

I am also one of them.","Misato:         I see.                They found her 7 days after they missed her.                That isn't like them.","Misato:         Might be.

We must accept the fact and then investigate the cause.","Misato:         Yet, we haven't yet known what he really is.

I am disqualified as his guardian.","Misato:         We are lucky because we live in the suburb of the town.                You were not involved, I'm glad at that.                Yet, next time, I cannot garantee that.                So, you will be taken care at Horaki-san's from tomorrow.

It's very bad to be late for school                from the very first day.","Rei:            You shit, why do you cover that guy?                Does it mean, you two are the cop of tea?"],"Report":["Report: We are currently 3.2% behind schedule, but we will be finished        by 23:10 today."],"Ritsuko":["Ritsuko: I'm dumbfound. She must have got lost again. ","Ritsuko: What did you do, Captain Katsuragi? We are short of hands   and time! ","Ritsuko: The possibility of it working is 0.000000001%. O9-system   seems a good name for it. ","Ritsuko: This is the Multi-purpose Humanoid Fighting Machine   EVANGELION which the humanity finally developed. ","Ritsuko: At present, the interception against Angel's attack is top   priority. We have no choice but to have someone get into it even   if there is a little potential for synchronizing with Eva. ","Ritsuko: It's impossible! Even the entry plug has never been inserted   yet. It can't move! ","Ritsuko: Don't worry. After your lungs fill with LCL, it'll directly   supply you with oxygen. You'll get used to it soon. ","Ritsuko: Japanese has been fixed to the system as the fundamental   rules for the operation of Eva. All initial   contacts are all right. ","Ritsuko: The armoring won't stand any more.     ","Ritsuko: The people of Public Relations Department seem to be glad    because they got the things to do at last.","Ritsuko: It's no wonder. A severe burden was imposed on his cranial    nerves.","Ritsuko: Will you defeat ANGELs? You are so optimistic as you were.     ","Ritsuko: Whatever the children think ......","Ritsuko: Complaints yet? You declared theatrically that you would take    charge of him, didn't you?","Ritsuko: Good morning, Shinji-kun. How are you?  ","Ritsuko: That's fine. Appearance positions, an emergency power   source, locations of armed buildings and recovery spots. Do you   keep all of them in your mind? ","Ritsuko: Well, I'll review the lesson again. Eva usually works with   electric power supply from the cable. If Eva use the internal   battery in an emergency, it can work only for one minute with its   full strength or for five minutes at most even with gain. ","Ritsuko: Now, let's resume the lesson of 'Induction Mode' where we   left off yesterday.  ","Ritsuko: Aim at the target in the center of the sights ...... switch   on!  ","Ritsuko: Next! ","Ritsuko: That he goes along with what others say obediently ......   It's how to get onin his life, isn't it?  ","Ritsuko: Telephone calls?  ","Ritsuko: He seems to have an unsuited personality for making friends,   doesn't he? Do you know a story of 'Hedgehogs' dilemma'? ","Ritsuko: Launch!  ","Ritsuko: Why are they there?  ","Ritsuko: Why do you think it is possible that ccivilians can be taken   in the entry plug without permission?! ","Ritsuko: It is because foreign bodies have been inserted. Noises are   detected in the nervous pulses. ","Ritsuko:But we have to put piloting of Evas into the hands of        14-year-old children.","Ritsuko: Start System Phase II.  ","Ritsuko: Ayanami Rei, 14 years old. 'First Children,' the first   testee found by Marduk Report. The exclusive pilot of Evangelion   Prototype Unit Zero. Her personal history was started afresh. All   her records have been erased. ","Ritsuko: We still don't know. However, the primary cause is   believed to be a mental instability in the pilot. ","Ritsuko: I see... Parts other than the core have been left intact.  This    truly is an ideal sample--I'm very grateful for it.","Ritsuko: You are correct. We do know the Angel is composed of matter which has    the properties of both particles and waves, just like light.","Ritsuko: (sigh) Only something like that.  And I've got nothing on   its working mechanism. ","Ritsuko: Well, the world is full of mysteries. Look, this is the Angel's inherent  wave pattern. ","Ritsuko: Right. Although the constituent elements are different from   humanity's, the arrangement and coordinates of the signals are   extremely like humanity's genes: 99.89% ","Ritsuko: Before you came to this city, Unit One went out of control during the   activation experiment. You may have heard about that?  ","Ritsuko: Commander Ikari helped her escape from it. He had to force open the   overheated hatch. ","Ritsuko: He burned his palm then.  ","Ritsuko: It was the taste. Although the raw materials are retort foods, you   made such a ...... ","Ritsuko: Shinji-kun, you'd better move out. You'd better not let your ill-behaved   roommate ruin your life.","Ritsuko: He'd have to cut through an incredible amount of red tape.    Shinji-kun just received his formal security card, you know. ","Ritsuko: Ayanami Rei's renewal card--I never got the chance to give it   to her. I'm sorry, but would you please deliver it to her home on your    way to Headquarters? ","Ritsuko: She's a good girl though. Like your father, she's not good   at... ","Ritsuko: Living. ","Ritsuko: The pilot was locked inside then. Commander Ikari helped her escape    by forcing open the overheated hatch.  He suffered the burns on his palm then. ","Ritsuko:Shinji-kun...","Ritsuko:The defensive chest armour was melted up to the third layer.        It's a good luck within a bad luck that the central control        unit was not damaged.","Ritsuko:You know you've devised an insane operation, don't you,          Planning Manager Katsuragi?","Ritsuko:The plan will work?  Really?        Special Positron Cannon for Eva.        Cyclotron Prototype 20.","Ritsuko:Our positron rifle cannot handle that much power.        What are you going to do?","Ritsuko:This was a SSTO (Single Stage To Orbit) rocket.        Its bottom armour was originally super-electromagnetically coated        and second section assures us it can withstand the enemy's         particle cannon for 17 seconds.","Ritsuko:Theoretically, yes.        However, I don't know if the accelerator and cannon will withstand         the blast. It's the first time firing with so much power.","Ritsuko:This arrangement is due to the fact that Shinji's synchronization        ratio is higher and we need more precise operation this time.        Since the positron beam is influenced by the magnetic field,        gravity field and the revolution of the Earth, it will not fire in         a straight line. Don't forget to adjust for that error--you must         hit the core precisely.","Ritsuko: Don't worry, it's just like in the textbook.        When the marks get together in the middle, fire.        The computers will do the rest automatically.        For a second shot, you will have to wait a little while to         replace fuses, cool down, and reload the rifle.","Ritsuko:Don't think like that.        You must hit and destroy it with one shot.","Ritsuko:You're wrong. Humanity needs more than Eva. In order for those         survivers to live, money is necessary.","Ritsuko: Well, in the history texts, it is explained as a disaster caused          by a massive meteoric collision. However, it is usually the case          that the true facts are consealed. 15 years ago, mankind found the          first humanoid creature, called an Angel, in Antarctica.         In the middle of the investigation, for some unknown reason it          exploded, and that's the actual incident known as the Second Impact.","Ritsuko: To avoid a probable Third Impact.         That's the reason for Nerv and the Evangelions.          By the way, the event will be held tomorrow.","Ritsuko:You mean the Strategic Self-Defense force? No, no interference         is allowed.","Ritsuko:According to the explanation, the unit is equipped with        an internal combustion engine.","Ritsuko:But looking at it from a safety perspective, you risk too much        using an internal reactor in a land-battle weapon.","Ritsuko:But there would be problems with remote-control in an emergency        situation.","Ritsuko:Say anything you want, but except for Nerv's primary weapon,        nothing can defeat those enemies.","Ritsuko:Impossible! Stop that, Captain Katsuragi? How are you going         to stop that?","Ritsuko:Unit One retrieval complete. No fear of radioactivity.        Except for Captain Katsuragi's operation, everything was done        according to the plan.","Ritsuko: are you going to seduce me?        But I don't accept you. Horrible lady is looking at us.","Ritsuko: The papers for protesting and the reports of damage from        the ministry concerned.        And, this is the claimed payment from UN. And the complain         from the publicity section.","Ritsuko: Vice commander is very angry!        You will be transfered if you humiliate him again. No doubt!","Ritsuko: You are wrong. It's not me that saves the tight pinch of an        old friend. This idea is Kaji-kun's.","Ritsuko:You should be more frank. Things are different from those 8        years ago.","Ritsuko:School excursion?        they are too relaxed in such a time.","Ritsuko: Yes. It's something like a chrysalis before adult.        The number one priority for this operation is to capture        the Angel.        Capture it alive and conserve the shape as original as possible.","Ritsuko: Anti-heat, anti-pressure, and anti-nuclear special suits.        The Type-D equipment for extream region.","Ritsuko: Since You and the target are driven by flow,        there's only one chance for the contact.","Ritsuko: High temperature and high pressure.        Target withstands that critical situation.        Progknife cannot work!","Ritsuko: A city councilmen's election will take place in the upper   town soon. ","Ritsuko: Yes, from 10:30 today the second experiment for extending   the activating time is to take place. ","Ritsuko: Stop the experiment. Cut off the circuits.  ","Ritsuko: Lower the interconversion by 0.01 and try with the same   setting again. ","Ritsuko: Well, we're starting an reactivation experiment. ","Ritsuko: No. I did nothing. ","Ritsuko: Anyway let's hurry to the control center. I can't believe   that the power supplies hasn't been restored. ","Ritsuko: I thought that a trap was only just an old-fashioned   ornament. I couldn't imagine that I use it. ","Ritsuko: Things are getting worse. The air is also getting staler.   That this facilities should be the best fruits of modern science. ","Ritsuko: You mean that they want to guess the structures of   Headquarters from the recovery procedures. ","Ritsuko: I'll run dummy programs on Magi because they makes it   difficult for them to gasp the whole. ","Ritsuko: Don't worry. I'm sure that they will come. ","Ritsuko: We have to only just wait for them. ","Ritsuko: You guys. ","Ritsuko: Commander Ikari has been preparing because you would come   here. ","Ritsuko: All are ready for activation with auxiliary power sources  ","Ritsuko: Well. They're ready. Sortie! ","Ritsuko:All clear...  Today too, my mother is just fine, but am I just aging?","Ritsuko: From here on is the super clean room.  Just takeing shower and        changing your undies are not enough.","Ritsuko:Not only the time progresses but also the technology of EVA.  We        need the new datas all the time.","Ritsuko:Now, all three of you, go through this room, stay as you are now,         and get into the entry plug.","Ritsuko:Don't warry.  The vidual moniters were turned off.  Your privacy         is protected.","Ritsuko:This test's point is to do harmonics directly from the body, without         the assistance of the plug suit.","Ritsuko: Well, I just did system-up.  My mother made the basic theory and        the body.","Ritsuko:Then continue.  This test cannot be aborted easily.  Commander Ikari        will be bugging us, too.","Ritsuko: (taking a breath) Change the login mode.  Tune synchro-code to every        fifteen minutes.","Ritsuko: They are micro-machines, the ANGELS with the size of virus.  The each        of them gathers to form a colony, and in these short times, they have        evolved expornentialy enough to from a intellegence circuit.","Ritsuko: Yes, sir.  They constantly evolve themselves and look for the best way        to cope with the situations.","Ritsuko:If the ANGELS consider effective means of the survival, they may        choose the co-existance with MAGI.","Ritsuko:If the target is the computer itself, we can reverse hack by directly        connecting Casper and the ANGELS, and by doing so, self-destruct         promotion code can be send in.  However...","Ritsuko:It's a long story.  But not much fan.  Do you know the personality        transfer OS?","Ritsuko:I do not think so.  I did not like my mother much.  It is a decision        as a scientist.","Ritsuko:Thank you.  This is the fast time I felt the coffee you made is         delicious.","Ritsuko:In Casper, pattern as a woman was input.   She stayed as a woman        untill last.  It is jut like my mother.","Ritsuko:The compatibility between Rei and Unit One has no detectable        problem.","Ritsuko:But good readings.        This means, we can carry out that plan.","Ritsuko:I understand why you don't want that.        But, the preparation is always necessary, in order for one to live.","Ritsuko:One with mysophobia always feels difficulty in living among people.        When you get dirty, you will find that.","Ritsuko:The same incident as that time?        Trying to possess Shinji-kun?","Ritsuko: Nothing I can say at the moment. One thing I can say at the moment        is, after returning the personal data of Rei to Unit Zero,        another synchronization test between Rei and Unit Zero is necessary.","Ritsuko: It must be me that Unit Zero tried to attack.        No doubt.","Ritsuko:        How about that orange one?                You don't have on that these days.","Ritsuko:        We've been invited so frequently that the amount of                 gratuity is that big.","Ritsuko:        It was when he dated.                His attitude was different when on job.","Ritsuko:        She drinked too much.                She looks frolicking.","Ritsuko:        Oh, thanx.                What a honest man you are. ","Ritsuko:        I doubt.                To Misato?","Ritsuko:        It's not my policy to talk about myself.                Nothing amusing.","Ritsuko:        It's no use pretending.                 Too much investigation will result in a burn.                This is an advise from a friend.","Ritsuko:        The power to conserve the present status, and the power                to change.                The things which have those two contradictory things are                living things.","Ritsuko:        I leave now.                I have a job left to do.","Ritsuko : I hear that Umbilical Cable was pulled up but          it lost its head.          ","Ritsuko : Energy remained withi the internal battery is little.          If Shinji-kun won't blindly move Eva and          if he can endure with life-support mode,-          he can survive for 16 hours.","Ritsuko : Yes, about 680 meter in diameter, about 3 nano meter in          thickness. It sustains that super-thin space with the          inverted A.T.Field, and the interior of the Field is the          imaginary space called \"Dirac's Sea.\"         It may connect to another space.         ","Ritsuko : It vanishes when the imaginary circuit of the body closes.        The object in the sky is nothing but a shadow.","Ritsuko : It's the only way that might be possible.        Dropping 992 existing NN depth charges  to the centeral portion,        in timing with,        interfering the imaginary circtuit of the Angel in 1 mili second        with two existing  Eva's A.T. Fields.        ","Ritsuko : In this operation, salvage of the body of Unit One         is the number one priority over everything.        We don't care if the body is destroyed.         ","Ritsuko : Trust me, Misto.        I'll command anything about this operation.         ","Ritsuko : We'll forward flights to the Kankuu airport.        Contact the air controll and the air transport division        of the JDAF.         Misato : (thinking) Second Impact, Project Instrumentality, and Adam.","Ritsuko : We shall bring the schedule 12 minutes forward.        while Shinji-kun is likely to be alive.        ","Ritsuko : Unbelievable. The energy within Unit One has reached zero point.-( the \"sphere\" in the sky suddenly splits and the bloody fingers  appears from the interior ...) ","Ritsuko : I've never felt Eva more horrible than today.        Is EVA truely our side ?        It may hate us.        Major KATSURAGI may be aware of something.        ","Ritsuko : If Rei and Shinji-kun know the secrets of EVA,        they may will never forgive us.        ","Ritsuko:still under investigation.        Only one clue is this image from a stationary satelite.        Nothing else remains.","Ritsuko: Probably, swallowed by Direc's sea, just like Unit One        at that time.","Ritsuko: Vanished.        And our dream also vanished.","Ritsuko:We are about to accept that.        U.S. administration does not seem to loose the first branch.","Ritsuko:This is the prototype dummy plug.        Rei's personality was transfered,        though, the human mind, spirit is not digitalizable.        This is nothing but a fake, something quasi,        which imitates the pilot's thinking. Nothing but a machine.","Ritsuko:Yes.        The adjustment and the booting test will be done at Matsushiro.","Ritsuko:Dummy plug is still dangerous.        One out of the present candidates will be...","Ritsuko:Yes.        There's one child whose core will be ready immedeately.","Ritsuko:In the booting test of the Unit three at Matsushiro,        we will use the fourth as the pilot.","Ritsuko:We had no choice.        The candidates were collected in one place        and are being protected.","Ritsuko: However, we need those childrens of that kind,        in order for all of us to survive.","Ritsuko:It is true.        Shinji-kun's syncro ratio is getting worse.","Ritsuko:I can say nothing.        But, I guess something happened in the last accident,        something mental.","Ritsuko: That's impossible.  He was not happy enough to brag around.          The condition he made was to transfer his little sister to the        head quater's medical unit.","Ritsuko:You don't sound that eager.  When this unit is delivered, this will        be under your direct command.","Ritsuko:  I heard that they cut the emergency hatch open           with a laser cutter, and he has been removed by force.","Ritsuko:  Yes, it's not an armor.          It's the restrainer for us to control EVA's intrinsic power.          The spell is now being dissolved by her own power.          For us, it's impossible to stop EVA any more.","Ritsuko: The bindings are being released themselves. We can't stop   Eva any more. ","Ritsuko: It may take a long time for everything to return to its   former state. ","Ritsuko: Well. For the present, we can only use the reserve Control   Center-02. ","Ritsuko: At present that's better than we can't use it. It's Unit One   which has been proved to be used. ","Ritsuko: The thing created by humans with a humanlike figure. I can't   say it in other way. ","Ritsuko: All of the materials which formed Shinji-kun are kept in the   plug. What should be called his soul exits there. In fact, his ego   image gives pseudosubstance to his plugsuit. ","Ritsuko: What a shame that I didn't make the original plan. These are   the data which came from the experiments done 10 years ago. ","Ritsuko: It was the accident before I joined Nerv. I heard that my   mother was there. I know it just by the data. ","Ritsuko: Stop the interference. Reverse the tangent graph. Set the   addition value to 0. ","Ritsuko: Repairment of Unit One will be finished the day after   tomorrow. ","Ritsuko: I don't know. The committee is also discussing freezing   plan. ","Ritsuko: It's beyond my ability. It's thanks to you, perhaps. Well,   how about having a drink after a long time? ","Ritsuko: After she knew that Shinji-kun was safe, she has a secret   meeting with a man. I've got no room to talk. ","Ritsuko:        Mom, the other day, I happened to make an acquaintance with                a girl named Katsuragi.                People always look at me from distant places.                That makes me remember the graveness of your name.                She is different. She is quite frank even to me.                I hear that she is the only surviver from that investigation                commission.                She seems to have once been aphasic. However, now that she                is quite talkative just like she is trying to recover                 the aphasic days.        ","Ritsuko:        For a couple of days, Misato had been absent from school.                 I forced her to confess why. She is like an idiot!                She had been in the bed with her boy friend in her flat,                without being tired of, for one week long.                I was impressed to know another side of her.                Today, she introduced me the guy.                He is handsome, though I am not used to that frivolity.","Ritsuko:        Mom, congratulations for your having completed the basic theory                of Magi.                I have a good news for you as the congratulations for you.                It was informally decided that I will officially join Gehirn.                From the next month, I will be engaged in Project E.","Ritsuko:        Akagi Ritsuko at Technology Development Devision.                This is my ID.                I hear that the basic installation of the commander's room                 was completed, so I came here to see.                Well, it's just like a maze here.","Ritsuko : Do you hear me, Asuka ?  Your Synchronous ratio decreased               as much as 8.   Don't think about extra things.              Do as you do usually.","Ritsuko : That troubles a lot !  We have no spare.          After all we should do the Rei's Unit-1 first.          We cannot repair both of them at the same time.--     ","Ritsuko : What a terrible status !               Her results are more worse than yesterdays.","Ritsuko : Synchronous ratio doesn't get affected by the external               body disorder.

It's the end of nice family game ?","Ritsuko : You mean if Asuka fails here, she will be dismissed. ","Ritsuko : We have to prepare in case of the change of               Unit-2 Pilot.","Ritsuko : Angel's psycho-attack ?               Can they understand the mind of human beings ?","Ritsuko : Her mental circuit is now getting damage  so               terribly.              Further overload will be  too dangerous.","Ritsuko :  Give the first priority to Life support.                Don't allow the back current from Eva.","Ritsuko : (monologue)              (That ray seems to scan Asuka's mental wave length               pattern.

You are free from secret service at the moment.                You can go out right now.","Ritsuko:        Ayanami Rei's room.                 This is the place where she was born and bred.","Ritsuko:        Yes. Her birth place.                Light and Water which consist Rei's deep mentality reflect                the image of this place.","Ritsuko:        Nothing but a dumping ground.                This is also the place where your mother disappeared.                Probably you don't remember, but you were watching that,,                watching the moment when she disappeared.","Ritsuko:        Yes. These are about to be the core of dummy system.                This is the factory for manufacturing these.","Ritsuko:        These are dummies.                And nothing but the parts for Rei.                Humans found a god, and thus, tried to obtain that.                As the result, punished were humans. That was 15 years ago.                Vanished the god that they found.                They, however, tried to revive the god by themselves.                That was Adam. Made from Adam to be close to the god was                a human.                Eva is that.","Ritsuko:        Yes, that's a human.                Eva which did not have a soul ab initio,                now that, has a human soul.                All of these are  salvaged.                However the vessel which truly contains a soul is Rei.                Only she has a soul.                No other vessels have a soul.                There was nothing within the room in the canvass.                These Rei-like things here do not have a soul.                Nothing but vessels.                So I destroy them, because I hate them.","Ritsuko:        Yeah, I know. Destruction.                These are not humans, but are humanshaped things.                I lost against THE THING. I could not win.                When he is in my mind, I can bear any insult.                I don't care about my own body.                But he, he did, ...                I knew that.                I am stupid, I am as stupid as my mother. Very stupid.                You can kill me, if you wish.                I am glad if you do that.","Ritsuko:        Commander Ikari,                My cat died,                which my grandmom had been taking care of.                I hadn't been taking care of it for long.                Suddenly now that I cannot see it again.","Ritsuko:        Now that I ain't happy even if you hold me.                You can do anything you like to my body,                as you did at that time.","Ritsuko:        Disappointed?                You have neither the expectation nor wish to me.                I have, nothing, nothing ...                what shall I do, mom..                ","Ritsuko:        Right.

That's how people live.                But, nobody can ever escape from that.","Ritsuko:        So did you let him hold you?                So did you let that guy hold you?","Ritsuko:        Excluding what you hate, you wished the world of solitude.                The mind of your own.","Ritsuko:        If you depend on Eva too much,                Eva itself will be yourself.","Ritusko: A night before her death, my mother told me MAGI are three of herself.        As a scientist, as a mother, and as a woman.  MAGI are three of those        fighting each other.  She left dilemma of human being on purposely        there.  To be honest, the program is slightly different from        each other. Since I seem like not to be a mother,        I cannot understand my mother as a mother.  But as        a scientist, I respected her.  And as a woman, I even hated her.  ","Ritusko : Oh, it's your fault if you lose Shinji-kun. Huh, remember that.
